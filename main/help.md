## Sprites.cpp


In this code, the image is read from a file using the XpmReadFileToPixmap function and is then drawn on the window at the specified x and y coordinates using the XGetImage and XPutImage functions. The program is set up to receive Exposure and KeyPress events, and an infinite loop is used to wait for these events to occur. The program will continuously draw the image on the window until the connection to the X server is closed using the XCloseDisplay function.
